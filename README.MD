Addon for [Sophisticated Backpacks](https://modrinth.com/mod/sophisticated-backpacks) that adds an upgrade to quickly apply potions from tanks.

* Pour potions to tank directly from bottles & fill bottles with potions from tank
* Apply potion from tank by pressing the button in backpack UI
* Apply potion in game by pressing upgrade activation hotkey

Currently, **requires [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)** because the mod uses potion liquids from Create.
